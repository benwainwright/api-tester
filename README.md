# post-turtle 🐢

`post-turtle` is a simple shell based [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) alternative written in TypeScript. It is designed to help developers make quick API requests on the fly without having to use something as heavy as Postman

## Disclaimer

This project is in its _very_ early stages. I make no guarantee about quality,
and the feature set is definitely a little thin on the ground at the moment

## Install

`npm install -g post-turtle`

## Usage

* Start interactive mode - `pt`
* Call saved command - `pt call <slug>`
